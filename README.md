The hardest part of building software is not coding, it is requirements：

## What I found interesting

What stood out to me is how the article makes requirements feel like the real source of risk, not implementation details. The example where a scenario is flagged as violating a signed requirement, then dismissed as impossible, and later shows up as a last minute defect is a good reminder that software projects often fail because humans mispredict real usage. It also highlights how requirements are not simply a checklist, they are assumptions about the world, and the world is the part that refuses to stay still.

I also liked the way the article explains why writing code is often the easier step compared to deciding what the software should do. Clear rules and objectives make automation and reuse easier, but most real products live in the messy space full of edge cases, tradeoffs, and changing stakeholder expectations. That framing helped me connect the idea of good engineering to asking better questions early, validating assumptions, and refining requirements as you learn.
